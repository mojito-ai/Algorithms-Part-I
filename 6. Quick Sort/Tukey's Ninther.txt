AT&T Bell Labs (1991). Allan Wilks and Rick Becker discovered that a qsort() call that should have taken seconds was 
taking minutes.

At the time, almost all qsort() implementations based on those in:
	1. Version 7 Unix (1979): quadratic time to sort organ-pipe arrays.
	2. BSD Unix (1983): quadratic time to sort random arrays of 0s and 1s
	
Solution: 

Basic algorithm = quicksort.
	・Cutoff to insertion sort for small subarrays.
	・Partitioning scheme: Bentley-McIlroy 3-way partitioning.
	・Partitioning item.
		– small arrays: middle entry
		– medium arrays: median of 3
		– large arrays: Tukey's Ninther
		
Tukey's Ninther: 
Median of the median of 3 samples, each of 3 entries. Approximates the median of 9 entries & uses at most 12 compares

e.g. "R" L "A" P "M" C "G" A "X" Z "K" R "B" R "J" J "E" 		//9 evenly spaced entries

	R A M	G X K	B J E
	
	M K E
	
	K
