System Sorts:

Sorting algorithms are used in broad variety of applications
	1. Sort a list of names.
	2. Organise an MP3 library.     					obvious applications
   	3. Display Google PageRank results.
    	4. List RSS feed in reverse chronological order. 
	
	5. Data compression
	6. Computer graphics (Convex hull)					non obvious applications
	7. Computational biology
	8. Load balancing on a parallel computer
	
	9.Find the median.
	10. Identify statistical outliers.					problems that become easy once sorted
	11. Binary search in a database.
	12. Find duplicates in a mailing list.
	
Java uses tuned Quick-sort for primitive types; tuned Merge-sort for objects -> It's the designer's assessment that if a
programmer is using objects, maybe space doesn't critically matter and if the programmer is using primitive types, maybe 
performance is the most important thing.

Arrays.sort().
	・Has different method for each primitive type.
	・Has a method for data types that implement Comparable.
	・Has a method that uses a Comparator.
	・Uses tuned quicksort for primitive types; tuned mergesort for objects.
