System Sorts:

Sorting algorithms are used in broad variety of applications
	1. Data compression
	2. Computer graphics (Convex hull)
	3. Computational biology
	4. Load balancing on a parallel computer
	
Java uses tuned Quick-sort for primitive types; tuned Merge-sort for objects -> It's the designer's assessment that if a
programmer is using objects, maybe space doesn't critically matter and if the programmer is using primitive types, maybe 
performance is the most important thing.
