/**
* <h1>Indexed Max Priority Queue: It is a traditional priority queue variant which on top of the regular PQ operations
* 								  supports quick updates and deletions of key-value pairs. </h1>
* 
* <li> Associate an index between 0 & N-1 with each key in a priority queue.
* <li> Client can insert and delete-the-minimum.
* <li> Client can change the key by specifying the index.
* <li> Suppose we have N people with different priorities that we need to serve. Assume priorities can change dynamically
* 	   and we always want to serve the person with the highest priority. To figure out who to serve next, we use a max IPQ
* 	   to sort by lowest value first.
* <li> Use Hash-table to convert key values to integer based.
