The git-repo includes algorithms used widely in computational science, computational biology and in all IT sectors. The algorithms are divided into the following categories:

1. #### **Union Find**
2. #### **Analysis of Algorithms**
3. #### **Stacks and Queues**
4. #### **Elementary Sorts**
5. #### **Merge Sort**
6. #### **Quick Sort**
7. #### **Priority Queues**
8. #### **Elementary Symbol Tables**
9. #### **Balanced Search Trees**
10. #### **Geometric Applications of BSTs**
11. #### **Hash Tables**
12. #### **Symbol Table Applications**

Proper care has been taken to ensure that the speed analysis and the space analysis is done. There is a classic space/time tradeoff and the author has ensured to ensure fast processing algorithms in accordance with Moore's Law. Still there might be several errors or performance bugs at some places. Users are welcomed to create PR's or fork the repository to create better performing algorithms.

> An algorithm must be seen to be believed. - Sir Donald Knuth

>For me, great algorithms are the poetry of computation. Just like verse, they can be terse, allusive, dense, and even mysterious. But once unlocked, they cast a brilliant new light on some aspect of computing. - Francis Sullivan
