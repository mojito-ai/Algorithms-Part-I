# Algorithms-Part-I
An ensemble of Data Structures &amp; Algorithms used in computational science. Designed in accordance with Princeton University MOOC (Coursera) &amp; programmed in Java

The git-repo includes algorithms used widely in computational science, computational biology and in all IT sectors. The algorithms are divided into the following categories:

1. Union Find
2. Analysis of Algorithms
3. Stacks and Queues
4. Elementary Sorts
5. Merge Sort
6. Quick Sort
7. Priority Queues
8. Elementary Symbol Tables
9. Balanced Search Trees
10. Geometric Applications of BSTs
11. Hash Tables
12. Symbol Table Applications

Proper care has been taken to ensure that the speed analysis and the space analysis is done. There is a classic space/time tradeoff and the author has ensured to ensure fast processing algorithms in accordance with Moore's Law. Still there might be several errors or performance bugs at some places. Users are welcomed to create PR's or fork the repository to create better performing algorithms.
