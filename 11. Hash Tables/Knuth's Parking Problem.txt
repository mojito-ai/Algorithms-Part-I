Model: Cars arrive at one-way street with M parking spaces. Each desires a random space i: if space i is taken, try
	   i+1, i+2, ......
	   
Interpretation: If every car starts looking for a parking space at random time (that's our hash function) then how far do
they have to go to look for space.

	1. Half full: With M/2 cars, mean displacement ~3/2
	2. Full: With M cars, mean displacement ~ (πM/2)^0.5

Analysis: Knuth Theorem
Under uniform hashing assumption, the average number of probes in a linear probing hash table of size M that contains N=αM keys

	1. Search hit ~1/2(1+1/1-α)
	2. Search miss/insert ~1/2(1+1/(1-α)^2)
	
If α=1/2	Search hit ~ 3/2
			Search miss ~ 5/2
